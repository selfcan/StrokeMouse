Custom mouse and trackpad gestures for macOS. Draw a stroke while holding a mouse button, draw with one modifier key (Trackpad Draw), or use experimental multi-finger Touch Gestures, then run shortcuts, open apps, window commands, media keys, Shell / AppleScript, and more. Gestures can be **global or app-scoped**, configs are **importable/exportable**, and everything runs locally from the menu bar.

## Features

- **Menu bar app**: enable/disable gestures, open settings, quit; icon tints by status (normal / paused / needs permission); optional **hide menu bar icon** (confirm if Dock is also hidden; reopen via Dock or relaunch to open settings)
- **Gesture library**: sidebar by **Global / per-app** (new gestures inherit the selected scope); search / filter / sort; multi-select batch enable, disable, delete; **JSON import/export** (skip or force-import duplicates)
- **Mouse drawing**: each gesture can independently use the right, middle, or a side button; only buttons referenced by enabled profiles are monitored
- **Trackpad Draw**: hold exactly one of Fn / Control / Option / Shift / Command (Fn by default) and move the pointer; pressing an additional supported modifier cancels that recognition attempt
- **Experimental Touch Gestures**: the built-in trackpad supports 34 gesture classes—three- to five-finger taps, double taps, and four-way swipes, plus two- to five-finger pinches, spreads, and clockwise / counterclockwise rotations
- **Touch Gestures master switch**: disable Touch Gestures without deleting configured gestures; private-backend failures degrade only the trackpad channel, leaving mouse and Trackpad Draw available
- **Per-gesture target**: choose the frontmost app or the app under the pointer at trigger-down; when a regular window exists, its exact window is frozen too, and app-scope checks and target-aware actions always reuse that target
- **Free-path recognition**: arc-length resampling + 1D/2D normalization + limited rotation; significant-turn structure gates; live stroke HUD while holding the trigger
- **App scope**: global, or pick apps by icon from installed applications (search / browse `.app`)
- **Actions**: shortcuts, open app (icon picker), URL, media keys, window actions, Shell / AppleScript (syntax-highlighted editor; AppleScript presets such as sleep, lock screen, empty trash, plus custom)
- **Polish**: UI in English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, and French (or follow the system language), light/dark appearance (system or forced), launch at login, hide Dock / menu bar icon, Sparkle in-app updates (falls back to GitHub Releases on failure)

## Requirements

- macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Xcode 16+ (for development builds)
- A mouse or trackpad can be used for drawn gestures; direct multi-touch primarily targets built-in Mac trackpads
- External Magic Trackpad support is best effort and may vary by model or macOS release

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

Install from the [project-maintained Licoy Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/Licoy/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew install --cask licoy/tap/strokemouse
```

StrokeMouse also supports in-app updates. To force Homebrew to check and install an upgrade, use:

```bash
brew upgrade --cask --greedy strokemouse
```

Uninstalling keeps your settings by default. Add `--zap` to remove them as well:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask strokemouse
brew uninstall --cask --zap strokemouse
```

You can also download the DMG for your architecture from the [official download page](https://strokemouse.com/en/download). Current releases use a stable self-signed identity and are not Apple-notarized. If Gatekeeper blocks the first launch, right-click the app and choose Open, or use System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Accessibility** | Global mouse / modifier listening (`CGEventTap`), shortcut injection, window AX actions |
| **Automation** | Optional; required when AppleScript controls other apps |

On first launch or **Settings → Permissions**, use in-app **Guide Me**: open System Settings and drag StrokeMouse into the list. Without trust the engine will not pretend to listen.

### Experimental Touch Gestures

Touch Gestures load Apple's undocumented `MultitouchSupport` at runtime through `dlopen` / `dlsym`; the private framework is not statically linked. It may stop working after a macOS update. A missing framework, symbol, device, or startup failure is shown as a trackpad-channel failure while mouse and Trackpad Draw continue to work—there is no simulated fallback or silent retry.

StrokeMouse does not intercept native trackpad events, so a macOS system gesture may occur alongside the bound action. Raw touch trajectories are neither stored nor logged. The first attempt to enable, save, or import enabled Touch Gesture profiles shows an experimental-risk confirmation. The master switch can later pause Touch Gestures without deleting those profiles.

The 34 supported Touch Gesture classes are:

| Family | Fingers | Variants | Count |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| Tap | Three / four / five | Single, double | 6 |
| Swipe | Three / four / five | Up, down, left, right | 12 |
| Scale | Two / three / four / five | Pinch, spread | 8 |
| Rotate | Two / three / four / five | Counterclockwise, clockwise | 8 |
| **Total** |  |  | **34** |

The first release does not support two-finger taps / swipes, modifier combinations, specific finger identities, continuously repeated actions, or user-adjustable recognition thresholds.

## Build & run

### Dependencies

```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

### Generate the project and open

```bash
./scripts/generate_project.sh
open StrokeMouse.xcodeproj
```

Or **Run** directly in Xcode (Scheme: `StrokeMouse`).

### CLI build (recommended)

Produces a stable path at `output/StrokeMouse.app`, which reduces repeated Accessibility prompts.  
Debug shows as **StrokeMouse Dev** (Bundle ID `com.strokemouse.app.dev`) so it can be authorized separately from the release **StrokeMouse** app:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh           # Debug → output/StrokeMouse.app (Accessibility: StrokeMouse Dev)
./scripts/build.sh --open    # open after build
./scripts/build.sh --release # Release (same display name / Bundle ID as shipping builds)
```

### Release packaging

Build ZIP, TAR.GZ, and DMG per architecture, and verify signature, entitlements, and artifact integrity:

```bash
# First time locally: ./scripts/generate-codesign-cert.sh --import
SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY="..." ARCH=arm64 ./scripts/package-app.sh
SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY="..." ARCH=x86_64 ./scripts/package-app.sh
```

Release packaging uses the stable self-signed identity **`StrokeMouse Release`** so Accessibility grants survive Sparkle updates. See `RELEASING.md` / `certs/README.md`.

Bump versions with `./bump.sh -v x.y.z [-p]`. Re-tag the same version and push with `./bump.sh -v x.y.z --force`.

### Tests

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme StrokeMouse -configuration Debug test
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app; a mouse icon appears in the menu bar  
2. Grant **Accessibility**, then enable gestures from the menu bar  
3. Open **Settings → Gestures** to review defaults or create new ones  
4. Choose an input: draw while holding a mouse trigger, Trackpad Draw while holding one modifier key, or perform a configured Touch Gesture
5. On a successful match, the bound action runs  

> **Short click vs gesture**: trigger down/up is temporarily captured by the engine. If you release before the minimum stroke distance, a normal click is replayed so the context menu still works. Once drawing starts, drag still moves the system cursor and stroke HUD, but the frontmost app does not receive a paired down/up—so no context menu appears or is selected. Left click and buttons not configured as triggers are always passed through.

> **Trackpad Draw**: modifier monitoring is listen-only and never consumes keyboard events; a short path runs no action. The path follows the system pointer, so either a trackpad or mouse can move it. StrokeMouse does not suppress the modifier's normal effect in the active app.

> Shortcuts activate the frozen app first and also bring its exact window forward when one was captured, which may switch focus or Spaces. Locations without a regular window, such as the Finder desktop, can still run shortcuts and **Hide App**; Close, Minimize, Zoom, Full Screen, and Center still require an exact window. A short click never activates the target.

Default gesture examples (right button by default; each gesture can use a different button):

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| ↑ | Mission Control (⌃↑) |
| ↓ | Application windows (⌃↓) |
| ↓← | Minimize window |
| ↓→ | Close window |
| ↑→ | Open Safari |
| →← | Play / pause |
| ↑← | Open GitHub |

## Config file

Path:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/StrokeMouse/gestures.json
```

Day to day, multi-select under **Settings → Gestures** to export / import JSON packages. For a full-library backup, copy the file above or edit by hand (keep the structure valid). Settings can **Reveal in Finder**.
