# Settings & menu bar

## Menu bar

Day-to-day controls:

- **Start / stop gestures**
- **Open settings**
- **Status tint** — normal; **yellow** when gestures are paused; **red** when Accessibility is missing
- **Quit**

Optional login launch, hidden Dock icon, and **hidden menu bar icon**. With the menu bar icon hidden, click StrokeMouse in the Dock or relaunch the app to open settings; if the Dock is also hidden, relaunch the app. General settings can restore the menu bar icon and **quit the app**.

Hiding both Dock and menu bar icons requires a confirmation so you do not lose every visible entry point.

## Settings sections

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Gestures** | Sidebar (Global / per-app) + list: search / filter / multi-select batch ops, import/export, editor |
| **General** | Appearance, login item, hide Dock / menu bar, quit |
| **Permissions** | Accessibility / Automation status, guided authorize, deep links |
| **About** | Version and product info |

## Gesture list

- Left sidebar groups by **Global** and **scoped apps** (similar to system shortcut scopes); **New** under an app pre-fills that scope
- Name, trigger, action, **scope (global or app icons)**, enabled state
- **Search** by name / action / notes; filter **All / Enabled / Disabled**; column sort
- Create / edit / delete; **multi-select** to batch enable, disable, delete, or export
- **Import / export** JSON packages: export the selection; on import, skip or force-import duplicates (forced duplicates are disabled by default)
- Defaults are editable and removable

## Gesture editor

Typical fields on a profile:

1. **Name** and notes
2. **Trigger**
3. **Path** — record free-path points (or direction-based templates)
4. **Action** — see [Actions](./actions)
5. **Scope** — global, or add apps by icon (search installed apps / multi-select / browse `.app`; stored as bundle ids)
6. **Enabled**

Hold the trigger to record; release to finish. Re-record until happy.

## Theme & language

- Appearance: follow system or force light / dark
- Copy: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, and French (or follow the system language)

## Onboarding

First launch may show a short guide. Permissions and this site remain the long-term reference.

## Backup & share

- **Day to day**: Settings → Gestures → export selection as JSON; import on another Mac
- **Full library**: **Show in Finder** to copy `gestures.json`. See [Config file](./config-file)
